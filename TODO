Implement a program search path.

Some work needs to be done on buffering character output. Repeated calls
to putch() with single characters are absurdly slow on the Pico. That's
perhaps not a huge deal in something that is generally slow, but it's still
not very elegant. 

TYPE command doesn't page.

ASM has been know to crash the emulator, under circumstances I haven't
been able to reproduce.
