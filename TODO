Most the of the built-in shell commands are crude, and need further work.

Implement a program search path.

Some work needs to be done on buffering character output. Repeated calls
to putch() with single characters are absurdly slow on the Pico. That's
perhaps not a huge deal in something that is generally slow, but it's still
not very elegant. However, my attempts to buffer character data internally,
and send it in bursts, have not been hugely successful. There are all
kinds of locking complications, and I suspect there are problem in that
area in the USB library. WordStar fails with buffering enabled, and the
particular feature of that program is it does a character read after
every write. The connection remains unclear to me. 

TYPE command doesn't page.

ASM has been know to crash the emulator, under circumstances I haven't
been able to reproduce.

CLS function

DIR should be able to match filename wildcard argument (STAT can)

FAT filesystem support needs to be tested with different block sizes
and block counts. In particular, it's not clear whether to use
FAT or FAT32, and which works best in particular configurations.
